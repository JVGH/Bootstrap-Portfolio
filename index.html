                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry"s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
                the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
                1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
                desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br><br>Contrary
                to
                popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
                from a
                Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
                the
                undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
                the
                theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
                dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used
                since
                the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in
                their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
